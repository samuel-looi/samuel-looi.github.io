							<strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							The ability to be aware and to understand the emotions and feelings of yourself and others and to apply them to your thoughts and actions
						</p>
					
						<p>
							<strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							IQ (intelligence quotient) is a score which attempts to measure cognitive abilities such as memory and rational thought. IQ is quite orientated around a single individual. Comparatively, emotional intelligence is more like social intelligence and is orientated around being good at reading and interacting with multiple individuals.						
						</p>
					
						<p>
							<strong>Why is it important?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							The majority of work is done in conjunction with others. Therefore having a high emotional intelligence will allow you to work more effectively and happily with others. It also allows you to understand yourself more which can give you a greater sense of what your goals should be and what to do.
