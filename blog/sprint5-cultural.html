				<p><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
				</strong></p>
				<p>I learnt that consistency is something that I’m quite lacking in and is something I should try to improve so I can achieve my long term goals. I learnt that my childhood of doing Kumon may have caused myself to become my inclined to solve things by myself. And that meditation is a good way to pay more attention to by body.
				</p>

				<p><strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
</strong></p>
				<p>Bring good, healthy values and ideas will productive mindset for programming. Empathy will allow you to connect more with your peers and also deepen your own understanding which would make you work better with others. Self awareness in learning means you can reflect on what you have done and thus improve the techniques you used to learn, thus allowing you to learn faster, which helps with programming.
				</p>
				<p><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
				</strong></p>
				<p>Nothing really surprised me. During the open day I was briefed that it’d consist of such things.
				</p>
				<p><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
				</strong></p>
				<p>Sprint 4 the last replit exercise.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
				</strong></p>
				<p>Personal skills are more important than technical skills. Your ability to connect and work well with others is critical in a workplace as you will be constantly working with others. Thus it is important to focus on these personal skills in the core learning modules.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
				</strong></p>
				<p>I’m not entirely sure how much I actually learnt from the core learning modules, I know that the core modules have taught me a few things, but I am unsure if it was really a good time investment.
