						<h2>Sprint 2 Cultural - new</h2>
						<p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
						</strong></p>
						<p>I hope to get a software related job after I finished after or during my university studies, as that’s the only field I am interested in. Personally, I also want to try earning some side income from making web games as I have been curious about the process of creating and earning revenue from web games. And it has always been a small dream of mine to make a game for other people to play online.
						</p>
						<p><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
						</strong></p>
						<p>I can get work done really fast if I’m in the right mindset which is a great strength of mine. Some limitations of mine are my communication skills, my tendency to be distracted and being able to do the foundation consistently for the 10 weeks with very little free time.
						</p>
						<p><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
						</strong></p>
						<p>Being able to concisely articulate my ideas to others and potentially correctly interpret and remember the ideas of others. Also keeping my focus for the 9 weeks.</p>
						<p><strong></strong></p>
						<p></p>
						<p><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
						</strong></p>
						<p>My communication skills, so I can better articulate my thoughts to others and interpret the words of others. Also to become more consistent with my work as currently I’m very sporadic which is both a detriment to my health and my long term goals. 
						</p>
						<p>I would also like more myself to become more disciplined and be able to do work for longer periods of time without needing to rely on the “panic monster”. 
						</p>
						<p>Also being better at giving and receiving feedback, having better leadership skills and greater self awareness and reflective skills would be nice as well.
						</p>
						<p><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
						</strong></p>
						<p>That they provide assistance if I need to and respond helpfully to any questions, as well as providing a good environment to work in. And that they make sure to teach us the soft and technical skills to become industry ready.
						</p>
						<p><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
						</strong></p>
						<p>That I learn both the soft and technical skills bootcamp provides and that I manage to develop the skills I have listed in the sections above.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Sprint 2 Cultural - old</h2>
						<p>My long term goal is to get a software developer job during or after I’m finished with my university studies.</p>
						<p>I would like to see my ability to communicate my ideas more clearly to improve. And to gain the knowledge of how to work effectively as a team when coding as I’ve never done that before.</p>
						<p>My strength is that I typically can get lots of work done in a short amount of time and I’m relatively used to it. However I’m not the best at communicating my ideas and occasionally get easily stressed.</p>
						<p>To manage my workload I will now do my work early, sleep early and mediate as I’ve found that has helped me become more productive.</p>
						<p>In the case that I need help I will seek my facilitator through email or slack. As long as I do my work early, I any issues I have should be able to be resolved in a timely fashion.</p>
						<p>I expect the facilitators to respond to messages and reply helpfully. And also to create a good learning environment.</p>
						<p>Fortunately for me I do not have any commitments for the rest of this year, so I’m all mostly free for eda apart from personal projects that I can put off to the side if the pressure gets too much.</p>
