						<h2>Sprint 2 Cultural</h2>
						<p>My long term goal is to get a software developer job during or after I’m finished with my university studies.</p>
						<p>I would like to see my ability to communicate my ideas more clearly to improve. And to gain the knowledge of how to work effectively as a team when coding as I’ve never done that before.</p>
						<p>My strength is that I typically can get lots of work done in a short amount of time and I’m relatively used to it. However I’m not the best at communicating my ideas and occasionally get easily stressed.</p>
						<p>To manage my workload I will now do my work early, sleep early and mediate as I’ve found that has helped me become more productive.</p>
						<p>In the case that I need help I will seek my facilitator through email or slack. As long as I do my work early, I any issues I have should be able to be resolved in a timely fashion.</p>
						<p>I expect the facilitators to respond to messages and reply helpfully. And also to create a good learning environment.</p>
						<p>Fortunately for me I do not have any commitments for the rest of this year, so I’m all mostly free for eda apart from personal projects that I can put off to the side if the pressure gets too much.</p>
