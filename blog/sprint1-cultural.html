						<h2>Sprint 1 Cultural - Identity, Values and Strengths Activity
						</h2>
						<p>My personal values are curiosity, achieving by only oneself and to work hard.
						</p>
						<p>Since I was young I was always relatively curious as to how things worked. This eventually lead me to programming where I self taught myself how to build games and basic websites. Because of that, it allowed me to get ahead of my peers and ultimately get a school award in my younger years.</p>
						<p>However, back a few years before then I was also doing relatively poorly in my subjects. This lead my parents to enroll me in the tuition known as Kumon - an after school tuition which forced you to do worksheets everyday. Because of this, I was required to spend half an hour to two hours everyday doing worksheets. After a few years of Kumon, I was starting to do worksheets which my parents could not help me with nor could the staff at Kumon teach me. This eventually this led me to learn how to solve these problems by myself and value achieving things by oneself and working hard.</p>
						<p>In my eyes, achieving work by myself without the help of others has likely increased my ability to problem solve. However at the same time I have become so used to solving problems on my own, that I would sometimes ask for other people’s help or opinions later than I should have. Because of that, it created both a strength and weakness.
						</p>
						<p>Another weakness I have is a lack of consistency. Often I try learning new skills but I always end up with my attention being directed to something else and I stop learning the skill, leaving the skill only partially developed.</p>

						<p><strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
						</strong></p>
						<p>This probably seems petty to most people, but back last year I had a personal ethical dilemma over helping a group of friends for an assignment that was supposed to be done individually. It was known that a large majority of people in my cohort would help each other for these assignments, however because I believed in doing work by oneself and because I wanted complete my assignment without needing to depend on others I did the assignment as it was supposed to be completed. There weren’t any significant consequences of this action as they knew my reasons and I still helped them for more lenient assignments.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</strong></p>
						<p>I don’t believe New Zealand culture has had much of an influence on me, though I do believe that my family culture of working hard has influenced my working culture. As I often saw my dad working and because my siblings and I were forced to participate in a number of music and sport events and competitions.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
						</strong></p>
						<p>Because I often self learn for curiosity's sake, I’m quite used to self-learning through online resources which helps a lot with improving my technical software skills. However due to my lack of consistency, I generally end up forgetting parts of what I have learnt which hinders the development of my technical skills.</p>
					
						<p><strong>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
						</strong></p>
						<p>Because I’m curious about a number topics, I have also developed more of my meta-cognition and learnt of tools to help with my learning. These factors will help me reflect more accurately on my actions and give me a better chance at completing the given tasks and my goals.</p>
					
						<p><strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</strong></p>
						<p>Last year I had a group project where one person was not pulling their weight for their part of the project. At first we just asked him more frequently whenever his work was required, which did increase his participation. However, near the due date he was unresponsive and thus we had to split the work between our remaining selves to complete the project.
							A different strategy that could have been employed could be just talking to him in person to ask what was up, to see if we could solve any issues that caused him to be unable to do his part of the project.
