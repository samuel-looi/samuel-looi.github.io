					<strong>
						An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					One could describe HTML and CSS to a home. A home has a general layout, has rooms of certain sizes, furniture and accessories, all of which represent the HTML - they are the content of the home. The CSS would be the looks of the content of the home, such as how many rooms there are, what their sizes are and the type of furniture and accessories.

					<strong>
						Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).

					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The basic control flow of JS is that code is executed top to bottom. In for loops, the code is executed repeatedly until a certain condition is no longer satisfied. A real life example of this could be flossing your teeth. You may want to floss your teeth, so you floss each tooth one by one until all teeth have been flossed (the condition), much like how an array would iterate over each element one by one executing a piece of code until all have been iterated (the condition).

				</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>
						Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The DOM is a tree structure for organising the contents of the webpage. You can interact with the DOM by using the following JavaScript:
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="code">
						document.getElementById()
						document.querySelector()
						element.classList.toggle()
					</span>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>
						Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Accessing data from arrays requires an index value, whereas objects always require keys. Arrays have inbuilt methods which allow for looping whereas objects donâ€™t and require using the Object constructor.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<strong>
						Explain what functions are and why they are useful.

					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Functions are just a sequence of commands, that can be called once declared. It can be useful to prevent rewriting the same code again and again, which increases legibility, productivity and maintainability.
