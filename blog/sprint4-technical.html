					For my last assignment I was initially quite stumped on how to remove all "buzz" words from a bunch of text. I was stumped on how I should go about the task and initially didn’t know where to begin.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					However after taking a small break, and asking myself what were the problems where and what I had to do, the solution became quite clear. In the end, I managed to elegantly complete the task with only 4 lines of actual code.
				</p>

				<p>
					From this I learnt that asking yourself and explaining to yourself “what exactly am I trying to do in terms of subtasks” is really important and can break a complex problem into manageable, small tasks.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Pseudocode: I believe I’m not the best at pseudocode as most of the time I like to do planning in my head instead. However for more complex tasks, I tend to use pseudocode as it helps me manage more thoughts. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Trying something: I quite often just test stuff out in the chrome developer console and thus I believe I’m quite experience at this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rubber ducky method: I believe this could skill could be developed more. I usually use other problem solving techniques so I believe it does not pose much of an issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reading error messages: This is another area which I believe I could improve on, as I find myself hesitating to look at the errors on occasion.	
				</p>
				<p>
					Console.logging: This is my main problem solving technique and I believe I’m quite good at it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Googling: I often learn stuff on my own and have been googling for information for a very long so I believe I’m quite proficient at this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Asking your peers for help: This is likely an area which I can improve on. I tend not to use this method of problem solving as it is unreliable and hugely dependent on external factors
				</p>
				<p>
					Asking coaches for help:  This is an area which I can improve on. I tend not to use this method of problem solving often as they won’t always be available and thus I should learn how to solve problems through more permanent methods.
				</p>
				<p>
					Improving your process with reflection: I believe I reflect relatively often but there is still room for improvement as I only reflect occasionally.
