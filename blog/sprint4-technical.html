					Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people

				</strong></p>
				<p>
					Understanding that the brain literally creates new and stronger connections when you perform activities. This indicates that anyone can learn anything. This can be used to counteract ideas such as “being bad at math because I’m not a math person”, enabling that individual to achieve greater joy and achievement in their life.
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>
					Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit

				</strong></p>
				<p>
					Because new and stronger connections are created, I’ll always be able to perform better if I just persist and practice, no matter how bad I believe myself to be at doing a particular task. 

				</p>
				
				<p><strong>
					What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity

				</strong></p>
				<p>
					<p>					Sleep: your brain creates new connections while sleeping and filters out all the toxins it produces. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Meditation: Studies have shown that this increases the rate of neuroplasticity
					</p>
					
					<p>Exercise: Aerobic exercise and high intensity exercise in particular, increases the production of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which creates new brain cells, increases synapses and preserves brain cells.
					</p>
					
					<p>Curcumin: This spice reduces brain inflammation, preserves healthy brain cells and increases BDNF
					</p>

				<p><strong>
						Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
				</strong></p>
				<p>It’s the mindset that you can learn anything. This means that there is nothing you can not learn and that all the activities that you have put off because you told yourself “I’m not a art/math/programmer” person, are not valid reasons and that you can achieve those skills
					</p>

				<p><strong>
						In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?

				</strong></p>
				<p>No, I’ve known most of this stuff before.
					</p>
					<p><strong>
							How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?

					</strong></p>
					<p>I won’t tell myself I can’t learn anything or if I encounter something that’s difficult, I will understand that it will make me growth and is a useful learning experience. And if I catch myself doing so, I’ll ask why am I unable to learn it.
						</p>

					</strong></p>
					<p>This resource demonstrated the power of the growth mindset and the goals it can achieve.

					</p>
							
					<p><strong>
							Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.

					</strong></p>
					<p>I’ll always try to catch myself if I ever believe I can’t do something. And I’ll tell myself that it goes against the concepts of neuroplasticity and that I’m not engaging in a mindset that will reap the benefits of a growth mindset which studies have shown to be extremely beneficial.
